# Imaging notes

## Filename convection
Files are assumed to be of the form of <code>basename_tX_sY_additionainfo.extension</code>, where <code>X</code> is a number indicating the frame and <code>Y</code> is a number indicating the stage position. Channel and worm label are encoded in <code>additionalinfo</code>. Allowed extensions are <code>.stk</code> and <code>.tiff</code>.

Alternatively, files of the form <code>basename_sY_tX_additionainfo.extension</code> can be read, by setting the <code>data_format = 'st'</code> in <code>utils.read_image_and_metadata.py</code>.
