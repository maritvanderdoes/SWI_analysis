# Package notes:

## Main functions
The package has two main functions for the average user. These functions are tuned in such a way that are friendly to use and requires little to no knowledge. For a more detailed description
- <code>swi_analysis_mcherry.py</code>: runs the analysis workflow and saves it in <code>results.csv</code>. For a description of this function, see **Analysis workflow** down below.
- <code>plot_complete_dataset.py</code>: plots the results from the workflow.

## The *Utils* package
These algorithms requires of our own package, utils. This package can be found in the repository and it is installed with the rest of the functions. 

## Analysis workflow
Here is a sketch on the operations that the main analysis code, <code>swi_analysis_mcherry.py</code>, performs:
1. Determines the files within a folder with the corresponding channels (masking and signal, mCherry and GFP). This is performed by <code>image_lists.py</code>.
2. Iterates over each file, loading one at a time. The information about position and time is retrieved. This is performed by <code>read_image_and_metadata.py</code>.
3. Using the masking channel (mCherry), a mask is generated. This is performed by <code>adaptive_masking.py</code>. For a detailed analysis in this function see [here](funs/adaptive_masking.md).
4. Worm properties are measured using the masking channel (mCherry) on the signal channel (GFP). Computed properties are _area_, _mean intensity_ and _min intensity_. This is performed by <code>calculate_worm_properties.py</code>. 
5. _(NOT AVAILABLE IN THE CURRENT VERSION)_ If selected, the worm is straigthened. 
6. _(NOT AVAILABLE IN THE CURRENT VERSION)_ Using the straigthening information, the head and the tail are operated.
7. Properties are saved on <code>results.csv</code>. 

## Development and troubleshooting code
The package has two main functions for the average user. These functions are tuned in such a way that are friendly to use and requires little to no knowledge. For a more detailed description
- <code>Development_with_synth.py</code>: Development code using synthetic data. This is created to test the performance of the different algorithms for the workflow. Current synthetic datasets are
  - 3D ball. This is generated by using <code>Generating_ball.py</code> from <code>utils.synthdata</code>.
- <code>Development_with_data.py</code>: Development code using synthetic data.
- <code>swi_analysis_mcherry_troubleshooting.py</code>: This code is intentionally developed to be run as <code>swi_analysis_mcherry.py</code>. This code additionally:
  - Prints and stores elapsed time.
  - Computes and stores the centroids of the worm.
  - Saves the mask and the masked data.


## Additional information and complementary packages
A note on this package, it seems that the version of scikit-image might be 0.15 instead of 0.17.
